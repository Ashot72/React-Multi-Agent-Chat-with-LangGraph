# React Multi-Agent Chat App Powered by LangGraph Server Agents

I built a **React Multi-Agent Chat App** powered by **LangGraph Server Agents**. The React app communicates with LangGraph Server agents and renders their responses. It can connect to any agent, including the **Supervisor Agent**.

The experience is similar to ChatGPT â€” users can edit a human prompt to generate alternative responses, view them as branches, and even regenerate AI responses for the same prompt. Additionally, the app supports **thread history**, allowing users to revisit and continue any previous conversation at any time.

## Agents

- **Chat Agent** â€“ Handles general conversations and allows users to upload images and ask questions about them.

- **Search Agent** â€“ Retrieves live data using **Tavily Search**.

- **Job Notification Agent** â€“ Uses **human-in-the-loop logic** (*interrupts*) to involve human decision-making at key points, such as selecting the best-fit employee and reviewing or editing AI-generated emails before sending.

- **Supervisor Agent** â€“ Routes prompts to the appropriate agent based on context.


# Setup Instructions

This project consists of two parts:

1. **LangGraph Studio** â€“ Runs the backend agents.
2. **React Multi-Agent Chat App** â€“ The frontend interface that connects to LangGraph Studio.
